<h1># kids_in_tow</h1>

<h2>Project Brief</h2>


<h2>Research</h2>

As a resident of Leeds, I decided to focus my site on the city of Leeds and surrounding areas.

<h2>Planning & Scope</h2>

As a parent, its always appreciated when others pass on suggestions and recommendations of great places to visit with your children.
Using the Google Maps API, I wanted to develop a site that caters to parents looking for places to visit that incorporates filters to rule in or out ones that hit their criteria.

Phase 1 would be focussed on Leeds with further areas to be developed as additional phases (not within the scope of this project).

<h2>Further Development</h2>

Phase 1 is focussed on Leeds as the focal point of the site with the intention of further developing the site to incporate other areas.

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
<ul>
<li>Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
<li>Different configuration files?
<li>Separate git branch?
</ul>
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
