The aim of Kit is to help the user discover perfect days out for all of the family to enjoy. The website equips users with the tools to tailor their search for a day out in Leeds utilising some pre-built filters such as free admission and accessibility. 

Kit compliments this with an interactive Google Map where the user can search for places to further enhance their day out in Leeds, searching for places such as eateries, transport, accommodation and other activities.


<h2>Project Brief - Interactive Frontend Development</h2>

The given brief of the project is outlined below:

<h3>Project purpose: Presentation of interactive data</h3>
In this project, you'll build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

<h3>Value provided:</h3>
Users are able to interact with the site in their particular way, to achieve their personal goals and derive answers to their specific questions.
The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves.

Three projects ideas/topics were given as part of the brief, of which I used the following as a basis of which to build and develop my ideas for Kit.

<b>Project Example Idea 1</b>
Create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination.

<h2>Research, Planning and Scope</h2>

The ultimate aim of Kit is to be a nationwide site covering all areas in the UK but due to resource and time constaints, it was pertinent to focus the initial scope of the project on just one area. As a resident of Leeds, I decided to focus my site on the city of Leeds and surrounding areas.

As a parent, its always appreciated when others pass on suggestions and recommendations of great places to visit with children. Using the Google Maps API, I want to develop a site that caters to parents like myself, looking for places to visit with their family. rporates filters to show results based on different criteria.

The scope of Phase 1 would be focussed on Leeds with further areas to be developed as additional phases (not within the scope of this project).

Initial planning focussed on 


<h2>UX Design</h2>

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

As a user, I want to:
<ul>
<li>Find places to visit with children that can be enjoyed by the whole family
<li>View on a map the places location
<li>Understand what the place has to offer in terms of facilities
<li>View pictures of the places as a visual aid
<li>Filter results based on criteria I have specified
<li>Find places with particular features, such as Accessible/Disability friendly
<li>Link to further information about the place i.e. their website
<li>Explore the surrounding area to find nearby places for example eateries, accommodation and transport links
</ul>

As a business user, I want to:
<ul>
  <li>Get in touch to discuss marketing of my place
  <li>Feature my place on Kit
</ul>

As a marketer, I want to:
<ul>
  <li>Make contact with Kit to discuss advertising options
</ul>

As the owner/operator of the website, I want to:
<ul>
  <li>Attract users in search of local attractions
  <li>Use advertising as a potential stream of revenue
  <li>Utilise paid features on the site for business wishing to market their place
</ul>

</ul>
</ul>

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

During the planning and research stages of the project, the scope was refined due to resource and time constraints so some features were left out of the original brief. Further development of this website would expand on the original scope to include some of these features left to implement. These include:

<ul>
<li>Regions - I would like to expand Kit to cover areas nationwide
<li>Improve filters
  <ul>
    <li>Expand on current filter options available

<h2>Trouble shooting</h2>

<h2>Testing</h2>

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


<h2>Deployment</h2>

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
<ul>
<li>Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
<li>Different configuration files?
<li>Separate git branch?
</ul>
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
